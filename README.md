# Mockify

A small website to transform strings in a silly way.

[Try it out yourself.](https://mockify.p6.gg/)

## What is it good for?

Absolutely nothing. But you can still use it to mock your friends.

Did one of them again write something stupid?

```
Harry, can't you just behave for like once??
```

Why not mockify their message and send it back to them to show them what they sound like?

```
hArRy, CaN'T YoU JuSt bEhAvE FoR LiKe oNcE??
```

## Pro Tip

Save the website on your mobile device, so you can easily access it as soon as you receive a dumb message.

The "copy to clipboard" button makes it as easy as mocking them in real life.
